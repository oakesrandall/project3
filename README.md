# Elevator Pitch
This is the readme for our project 3 app Foodr-app.  This app will show users random photos of food from restaurants in their area and allow them to say whether the food looks good or not.  When a user likes several photos of food from the same restaurant, the app will notify the user that they've "matched" with that restaurant and show them the restaurant's details.
