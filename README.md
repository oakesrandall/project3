This is the readme for our project 3 app.  This app will show users random photos of food from restaurants in their area and allow them to say whether the food looks good or not.  When a user likes several photos of food from the same restaurant, the app will notify the user that they've "matched" with that restaurant and show them the restaurant's details.

This is test
